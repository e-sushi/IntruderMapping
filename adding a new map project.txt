Steps to add a new map project:
1.) Open Unity Hub and go to the Projects tab on the left.
2.) Click "New Project" and make sure the 3D option is selected.
3.) Give the project a name WITH NO SPACES and set the Location to the same directory this text file is in.
4.) Let it create the project.
5.) VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!
	When it is done, you must copy the "template.gitignore" file in this directory into the new one that Unity has just made and rename it to ".gitignore".
6.) In the new project directory, make the "Blender" and "Solidworks" folders in "Assets".
7.) Push the new project into the repo.
8.) Import the IntruderMM package into your project.
